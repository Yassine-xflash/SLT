## üìÅ Project Structure

An overview of the key directories:

*   `./app/`: Core Next.js App Router pages (like `page.tsx`), layouts (`layout.tsx`), and global styles (`globals.css`).
*   `./src/screens/`: Houses main screen components.
    *   `Box/Box.tsx`: The central component orchestrating the homepage content and its various sections.
    *   `Box/sections/`: Contains specific large-scale sections of the homepage, including dedicated views for different screen sizes (e.g., `HomepageDesktopByAnima.tsx`).
*   `./src/components/ui/`: Reusable UI elements such as Buttons, Cards, Accordions, etc., many adapted from Shadcn/UI patterns.
*   `./src/lib/`: Utility functions, like `cn.ts` for class name construction.
*   `./public/`: Static assets such as images, logos, and SVGs.

## üö¶ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
*   npm or yarn

**Installation:**

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/STLverse/STLverse-website.git
    ```
    *(Note: Replace with the actual repository URL if different)*
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd STLverse-website
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```

**Running the Development Server:**

*   Execute:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # OR
    yarn dev
    ```
*   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

**Building for Production:**

*   Execute:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
*   This will create an optimized production build in the `.next` directory.

**Running in Production Mode (after build):**

```bash
npm run start
# OR
yarn start
```

## üé® Styling & Responsiveness

*   **Styling:** The project uses Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling. Global styles and Tailwind directives are defined in `app/globals.css`. Custom CSS variables for theming (colors, radius) are also present in `app/globals.css`, supporting light and dark modes.
*   **Responsiveness:**
    *   The website is designed to be 100% responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
    *   The primary approach involves rendering distinct component trees for different breakpoints, controlled by Tailwind CSS responsive classes:
        *   `src/screens/Box/sections/HomepageDesktopByAnima.tsx` (visible on `lg` screens and up via `hidden lg:block`)
        *   `src/screens/Box/sections/HomepageTabletByAnima.tsx` (visible on `md` screens, hidden on `lg` and up via `hidden md:block lg:hidden`)
        *   `src/screens/Box/sections/HomepagePhoneFinalByAnima.tsx` (visible on screens smaller than `md` via `block md:hidden`)
    *   Individual components also utilize Tailwind's responsive prefixes (e.g., `md:text-lg`, `lg:grid-cols-3`) for fine-grained layout adjustments.

## üñºÔ∏è Key Components (Examples)

*   **`app/page.tsx`:**
    *   Role: The main entry point for the homepage within the Next.js App Router. It directly renders the primary content orchestrator, `<Box />`.
*   **`src/screens/Box/Box.tsx`:**
    *   Role: The central component that aggregates and displays all major sections of the homepage, including the responsive views (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile) and other shared content blocks like visual identity showcases.
*   **`src/components/ui/button.tsx`:**
    *   Role: A versatile, reusable button component with various visual styles and sizes, built using `class-variance-authority` and Radix UI's Slot for composition. Marked as a `'use client'` component.
*   **`app/layout.tsx`:**
    *   Role: The root layout for the application. It defines the main `<html>` and `<body>` structure, imports global CSS (`app/globals.css`), and configures global fonts using `@next/font`.
